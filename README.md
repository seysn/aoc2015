# My AdventOfCode Solutions
This is a personal repository of the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenge. I used C, C++ and Python languages to resolve these problems.

Sometimes, challenges had an input file with it, which are in the *inputs* folder.

I also included programs that are not working (marked with a *NW*), because they can run and/or compile. They are not working, mainly because i didn't understand correctly the problem.

The source files marked with a *bis* mean it's the part 2 of the problem.
